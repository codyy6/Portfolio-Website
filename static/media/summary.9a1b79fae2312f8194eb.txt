Driven by a passion for coding and a desire to create positive change, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in AI. My journey has led me into the dynamic world of Web3, where I'm eager to apply my skills in blockchain and AI to revolutionize Malaysia's ecosystem. I envision a future where finance is available to all public and with ease.

Beyond the realm of technology, I find balance and inspiration through reading, exercise, and exploring new experiences. Reading expands my horizons, cultivating critical thinking and a broader perspective. Exercise serves as a mental reset, enhancing focus and clarity. Embracing the unfamiliar fuels my curiosity and personal growth.
