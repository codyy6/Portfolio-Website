Driven by a passion for coding and a desire to create positive change, graduated with a Bachelor's degree in AI. My journey has led me into the dynamic world of Web3, where I'm eager to apply my skills in blockchain and AI to revolutionize Malaysia's ecosystem. I envision a future where finance is available to all public and with ease.
